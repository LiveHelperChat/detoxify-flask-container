# Detoxify Rest API docker image

HTTP API to classify the toxicity of text messages. This was inspired by [detoxify-flask-container](https://github.com/nedix/detoxify-flask-container) with a few changes

* Proper JSON response
* Three models loaded directly `multilingual` `original-small` `original`
* Build fixes I encountered
* Memory leaks I found were fixed

## Usage

### 1. Start the service

The following command starts the service on port `8080`.

Pulls image always

```shell
docker run --pull always --rm --name lhc-detoxify \
    -p 8080:80 -e DETOXIFY_MODEL="original-small" \
    remdex/lhc-detoxify:latest
```

Runs local image if it exists. Useful if you are building custom image

```shell
docker run --rm --name lhc-detoxify \
  -p 8080:80 -e DETOXIFY_MODEL="original-small" \
  remdex/lhc-detoxify:latest
```

Restart on failure

```shell
docker run -d --pull always --name lhc-detoxify -p 8080:80 -e DETOXIFY_MODEL="original-small" --restart always remdex/lhc-detoxify:latest
```

### Build from scratch

```shell
docker build  --progress=plain -f Containerfile -t remdex/lhc-detoxify .
```

### 2. Request toxicity information

The following command sends a HTTP request that classifies the toxicity of a text message.

```shell
curl '127.0.0.1:8080?text=foobar'
```

## Known issues

There is still a memomry leak whcih I could not trace back and I think it's related to `Detoxify` package itself. It's recomended to restart docker image daily etc.

```shell
12 12 * * * /usr/bin/docker restart lhc-detoxify /dev/null 2>&1
```
